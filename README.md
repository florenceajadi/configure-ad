<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: How to Deploy on-premises Active Directory within Azure Compute](https://youtu.be/cG7M3Z-Cek4)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Setup resources in Azure
- Ensure connectivity between Client-1 and Domain Controller (DC-1)
- Installing Active Directory
- Creating an Admin and Normal User account in AD
- Join Client-1 to your domain
- Setup Remote Desktop (RDP) for non-admin users on Client-1
- Create a bunch of additional users and attempt to log into Client-1 with one of the users
